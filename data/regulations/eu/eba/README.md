### Subsection 8.1 (paragraphs 177-183)
Details the requirements for assessing the borrower's ability to meet their obligations. It specifies that lenders must consider the borrower's income, expenses, and other financial commitments to ensure they can repay the loan.

### Subsection 8.2 (paragraphs 184-192)
Focuses on the verification of consumer income. It specifies that lenders should not rely solely on information provided by the consumer without adequate verification.

# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Governs the use of personal data, which is central to a loan application. The key article relates to automated decision-making.

## Key sections of GDPR needed for compliance

### Article 22: Automated individual decision-making, including profiling
This article states that a data subject has the right "not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing." This is the legal basis for ensuring the AI solution assists a human decision-maker and does not automatically reject applicants. The output of the AI must be an input to a human, not the final decision itself.
