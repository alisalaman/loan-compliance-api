Source: https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/CONC.pdf

This document outlines the key sections of the UK FCA Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC) that are relevant for AI systems assessing consumer credit applications. The AI must ensure compliance with these regulations.

## Key sections of CONC needed for compliance

### CONC 5.2A: Creditworthiness Assessment
This section mandates that a firm must undertake a thorough creditworthiness assessment before granting credit.

### CONC 5.3: Basis of assessment
This is critical. It specifies that the assessment must be based on the consumer's income and expenditure and their ability to make repayments over the life of the loan. The system must verify that this check has been done.

### CONC 7: 
This section outlines how firms must treat customers who are in financial difficulty. The AI can look for indicators of financial stress and flag that these rules may apply.
Arrears, default and recovery

# Guidance for firms on the Fair Treatment of Vulnerable Customers (FG21/1)
This defines what a "vulnerable customer" is and sets expectations for how they should be treated. It's not a hard rulebook but official guidance that the FCA uses to assess firms' conduct.

## Key Sections of FG21/1 needed for compliance

### Chapter 2: Understanding the needs of vulnerable consumers
This chapter identifies the four key drivers of vulnerability: Health, Life events, Resilience, and Capability. The AI should be programmed to look for indicators related to these drivers in the application notes (e.g., "illness," "bereavement," "job loss," "high stress," "confused").

### Chapter 3: Practical application
Focus on the expectation for firms to have policies to identify vulnerability and for staff to have the necessary skills. The AI is a tool to help staff meet this expectation.
