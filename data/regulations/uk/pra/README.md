The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) is part of the Bank of England and is responsible for the prudential regulation and supervision of banks, insurers, and investment firms in the UK. Its primary focus is on ensuring the safety and soundness of these institutions, which includes overseeing their risk management practices and capital adequacy.  

The PRA sets standards for a firm's internal risk management models and capital adequacy. It's less about individual rules on a form and more about whether the bank's overall lending practice is safe.

## Key sections of PRA needed for compliance

### Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)
While not a single document section to "read," the ICAAP is a core PRA concept you must be aware of. Banks must have robust internal processes to assess their risks and ensure they hold enough capital to cover potential losses from those risks. 

The data from every loan application (income, credit score, loan-to-value, etc.) is a vital input into FinTrust's high-level risk models (e.g., models that calculate Probability of Default). These models are a cornerstone of the bank's ICAAP, which is scrutinised by the PRA.

The AI solution doesn't check a specific PRA rule on the application form. Instead, the risk assessment output produced by the system can be used to create a more accurate, nuanced risk score for each applicant. This, in turn, improves the quality of the data feeding into the bank's ICAAP models, helping the bank better demonstrate to the PRA that it is managing its credit risk effectively. Capturing documents related to credit risk modelling standards is key. A good example is Supervisory Statement SS11/13, which, while broad, discusses the need for robust processes for assessing risks.
