This document outlines the key sections of the UK FCA Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC) that are relevant for AI systems assessing consumer credit applications. The AI must ensure compliance with these regulations.

## Key sections of CONC needed for compliance

### CONC 5.2A: Creditworthiness Assessment
This section mandates that a firm must undertake a thorough creditworthiness assessment before granting credit.

### CONC 5.3: Basis of assessment
This is critical. It specifies that the assessment must be based on the consumer's income and expenditure and their ability to make repayments over the life of the loan. The system must verify that this check has been done.

### CONC 7: Arrears, default and recovery
This section outlines how firms must treat customers who are in financial difficulty. The AI can look for indicators of financial stress and flag that these rules may apply.
