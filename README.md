API for detecting loan application risk and compliance within various jurisdictions

## Regulations
This API is designed to help financial institutions ensure compliance with various regulations related to loan applications. It provides insights into the key sections of relevant regulations and how they apply to AI systems assessing consumer credit applications.

Regulations that the system needs to comply with can be found at [data/regulations](data/regulations/README.md). Each subdirectory contains regulations for a specific jurisdiction, such as the US or UK, and includes relevant sections that the AI system must adhere to when assessing consumer credit applications.
