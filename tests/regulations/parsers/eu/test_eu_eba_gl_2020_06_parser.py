As part of the EU's response to tackling the high level of non-performing exposures, the Council

adequate data infrastructure, to ensure that information regarding their credit risk exposures,
borrowers and collateral is relevant and up to date, and that the external reporting is reliable,
complete, up to date and timely.

risk exposures in line with their credit risk appetite, strategy, policies and procedures at
portfolio and, when relevant and material, individual exposure levels.

documented, is integrated into the institutions' risk management and control frameworks, and
allows all credit exposures to be followed throughout their life cycle.

is compatible and used for the institution's own risk management purposes.
